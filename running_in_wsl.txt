1. Install wsl version 2 and Ubuntu 22.04.3
	a. Start powershell as administrator
	b. Run wsl --install
	c. For me hyperthreading was already enabled but if not you might have to enable that from the BIOS
	d. Check if WSL is version 2 with "wsl -l -v"
	e. If it's not 2 then run "wsl --set-default-version <Version#>", replace <Version#> with 2
	d. Install and run Ubuntu 22.04.3 from the Microsoft Store

2. How to install perf in WSL:
	a. sudo apt install build-essential linux-tools-generic
	b. Try running /usr/lib/linux-tools/<linux-version>-generic/perf
	c. For the linux version do an "ls /usr/lib/linux-tools/"
	d. If this is the first time it should tell you to edit sysctl.conf file to run perf

3. Add "kernel.perf_event_paranoid = -1" (without the ") at the end of /etc/sysctl.conf file. You need sudo to edit the file.

4. Restart computer and perf should now work. Restarting just Ubuntu didn't work for me. Idk why.

5. Running "/usr/lib/linux-tools/<linux-version>-generic/perf stat -e cycles -a -A ls" should give something like this:

	Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

	       0.001288419 seconds time elapsed
	       
6. Run "git clone https://github.com/T-449/binaries.git" and "cd binaries/"
	     
6. Replace the perf commands in line 21 of run.sh files in KEM and SIG directories with "/usr/lib/linux-tools/<linux-version>-generic/perf"
	       
7. Run "run.sh" from the binaries directory

8. Once it completes there should be 2 directories "perf_outputs" and "mem_outputs" in the KEM and SIG directories

P.S: Files inside WSL can be accessed from Windows 

9. Please make a zip file with those 4 directories including a txt with system specs and mail it to oddjobs473@gmail.com

10. Thanks for the effort :)
